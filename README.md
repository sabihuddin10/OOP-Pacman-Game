### 🔧 Object-Oriented Structure

| Class         | Responsibility                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `map`         | Maze design and layouts for each level         |
| `entity`      | Base class for characters (Pacman and Ghosts)  |
| `Pacman`      | Player character and movement logic            |
| `Enemy`       | Ghost logic and BFS pathfinding                |
| `Player`      | Controls game state and character interaction  |
| `ScoreBoard`  | Tracks and displays score                      |
| `Audio`       | Manages background music                       |
| `losewinSound`| Plays victory/defeat sound effects             |

## 📦 Requirements

- Windows OS (console-specific)
- Sound files (e.g., `8-Bit-Cody-Rhodes.wav`, `mixkit-video-game-win-2016.wav`) in the same directory as the `.exe`
- C++ compiler with Windows API support:
  - MinGW (TDM-GCC)
  - MSVC (Visual Studio)

---

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOP_PACMAN_GAME.git
   cd OOP_PACMAN_GAME
   ```

2. **Ensure sound files** are in the same directory as the `.exe`

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mingw32-make
   ```

4. **Run the game**
   ```bash
   ./PACMAN-SABIH_ANAS_ARHAMOOP.exe
   ```

---

## 📘 Usage

- Run the game and follow the menu prompts.
- Play the game with arrow keys.
- View player records from the main menu.

---

## 💡 Notes

- This game is designed for **Windows consoles only** and may not run on other platforms without modification.
- Sound features will not work if the `.wav` files are missing.
- Ghost movement via BFS may be predictable; adding randomness would enhance difficulty.
